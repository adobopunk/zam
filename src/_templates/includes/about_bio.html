    <h2 class="about__title">I'm Tifa Jade, but you can call me TJ.</h2>

    <p>
      I’m a Creative Director and Producer with a deep love for executing
      ambitious ideas, directing animation that impresses, and telling stories
      that move people.
    </p>
    <p>
      My creative journey began when I was very young, making stop-motion films
      with toys. Later, as a student filmmaker I would first discover my
      leadership abilities — inspiring teams to work together to create stories
      that hit on a human level and won awards at film festivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same spirit led me to my first leadership role as Creative Services
      Director at a small NBC affiliate in Eastern Washington. There, I worked
      directly with local businesses to develop campaigns, direct commercials,
      design graphics, and shape brand identities from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I wanted to tell deeper stories. I pitched and solo-produced a
      documentary series about a high school football team, which aired on
      regional television and landed me a role at UFC, the biggest combat sports
      promotion in the world. There, I spent four years telling stories at the
      highest level of sports — directing features, shaping campaigns, and
      working with global partners to bring heart to one of the most intense
      sports in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, I combined my creative background with my love of gaming,
      stepping into a Creative Producer role at BoomTV, an esports-focused,
      experiential marketing agency serving gaming and tech clients. There, I
      shaped creative identities for 400+ branded events and campaigns,
      directing trailers, designing graphics, and shaping content strategy —
      with over 100 million viewers seeing my work through high-profile clients
      like Xbox, Fortnite, and Mountain Dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I lead creative projects through my agency,
      <a href="https://www.tinypond.studio" target="_blank">Tiny Pond</a>, and
      continue to design and produce esports events at
      <a href="https://www.playinqueue.com" target="_blank">In Queue</a>, an
      independent gaming events brand, as well as taking on freelance work for
      creators and musicians. While I’ve worked with some of the biggest names
      in sports and entertainment, at the end of the day, it’s all about the
      craft. I love bringing ambitious ideas to life, developing workflows that
      solve problems, and pushing the limits of what's possible.
