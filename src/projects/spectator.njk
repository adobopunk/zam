    <p>
      The Spectator is Seattle University's student-run newspaper. I joined The
      Spectator in fall 2023 as a volunteer designer and became a staff designer
      in winter quarter. I developed the ability to work efficiently under tight
      deadlines, collaborated with the editorial layout team, and became
      proficient in applying the brand guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2024-2025, I stepped into the role of lead designer, collaborating with
      the editorial team to coordinate design projects and guide a talented
      group of three layout designers through lively layout nights. I also had
      the exciting opportunity to create a new logo for a campus podcast, Cherry
      Street Chat.
