<p>
  This mini zine was created as a Christmas gift for my little sister. Every
  time I visit home, I find coloring crayons and pencils scattered around, so I
  thought this gift would give her a chance to put them to use.

<div class="side-by-side">
  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>
    The idea was sparked quite quickly so I began sketching and those sketches
    turned into the final drafts with tweaks and cleaner lines of course. I
    wanted the coloring book to be quite rough but interactive and silly.
