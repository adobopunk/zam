  In January 2025, I learned about a "Cookies and Consent" event for Love Month,
  where stickers would be handed out. Excited by the idea, I volunteered to
  design the stickers for the event.

<h2>Project Brief</h2>

<p>
  Design stickers to distribute at an informational event about consent and
  boundaries, tailored for a university student audience. The project was to be
  completed within a two and a half week turnaround time.
</p>
<h2>First Sketches</h2>

  <p>
    From these initial sketches, we decided that if we included a "No means No"
    sticker, we should also have a "Yes means Yes" version. We moved away from
    the "Consent is Sexy" concept and refined the "Love, Respect, Consent"
    design. The "Can I kiss you?" sticker is a playful reference to the Frog
    Prince tale, and the bunny was reworked into its own, more fitting sticker.
  </p>

</div>
<p>
  From the initial sketches, I moved into some more refined sketches, focusing
  on clarity and visual appeal. Each concept was iterated on to better
  communicate the intended message and to ensure the designs would resonate with
  the target audience.
