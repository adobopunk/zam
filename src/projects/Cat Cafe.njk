    <p>
      In mid-April 2025, I was approached by the event coordinator to create
      marketing materials for the annual Cat Cafe event. As part of Mental
      Health Awareness Month, Neko Cat Caf√© hosted a cozy, relaxing evening with
      furry feline friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the opportunity to develop a fresh visual style for the event,
      aiming to create something unique and memorable. Drawing inspiration from
      mid-century modern design and minimalist yet bold aesthetics, I crafted a
      look that set this Cat Cafe event apart.

<h2>Sketches</h2>
<p>
  My initial sketches explored four different concepts: two cats sharing a kiss,
  cats on shelves, cats separated by an invisible grid, and cats on a windowsill
  surrounded by greenery and outdoor elements.

</div>
<p>
  After discussing with the event coordinator, we decided to merge the shelves
  concept with the spaced-out grid approach. This combination allowed for an
  airy composition and provided space for the elements and information to
  interact in a dynamic way.
</p>
<h2>Digitizing</h2>

</div>
<p>
  I initially illustrated many elements, but my main concern was overwhelming
  the composition. Since this event poster needed to captivate a student
  audience at a fleeting glance, I decided to minimize the main illustrations. I
  leaned into a Bauhaus-inspired style, rather than the prominent mid-century
  modern look I originally envisioned, to achieve a cleaner and more impactful
  design.
