# Zam's Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This is a fully custom-built site showcasing my work as a graphic designer. The site is fully open-source, made with Pico CSS and deploys via 11ty on Netlify.

## Features

- **Custom Design**: Every aspect of the site was designed and coded from scratch.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for all screen sizes and devices.
- **Hero Video Background**: A dynamic hero section with a custom embedded background video.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Allows switching between light and dark mode for accessibility, and respects user preference on first visit.
- **Modular Showcase**: Sections for 2D & 3D animation, motion design, and video production.
- **Lightweight**: Images and videos compressed with ffmpeg to maintain quick load times.

## Tech Stack

- **Nunjucks**: Markup for structuring content.
- **SCSS**: Custom styles, including responsive design and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features and smooth scrolling.
- **11ty (Eleventy)**: Static site generator for fast builds and deploys.
- **Netlify**: Hosting and continuous deployment.
